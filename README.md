# NYTimes-React

## About This App

This app is an example of using React.  It uses the New York Times API to allow users to search for articles based upon a subject and between certain years.  It then lists the top 10 articles found and allows the user to save them for later.  By clicking on Saved Articles, the user can see which articles have been saved.  From there, they can delete the articles from the saved list.

If no articles are found when searching, the app will give an appropriate message.

If no articles have been saved or if the last saved article has been deleted, the app will give an appropriate message.
