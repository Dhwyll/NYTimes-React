# NYTimes-React

## About This App

This app is an example of using React.  It uses the New York Times API to allow users to search for articles based upon a subject and between certain years.  It then lists the top 10 articles found and allows the user to save them for later.  By clicking on Saved Articles, the user can see which articles have been saved.  From there, they can delete the articles from the saved list.

## Incomplete

Currently, this app is incomplete.  It does allow the user to search for articles and save them.  It also allows the user to view the saved article page.  However at this time, the saved article page does not display the saved articles nor is there a way to delete them.
